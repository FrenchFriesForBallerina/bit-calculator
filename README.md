## Purpose

A calculator to convert binary to decimal. I built it while working on a [Duckiebot](https://github.com/duckietown) project and it has helped me to visualise IR-sensors data coming from [SparkFun Line Follower Array](https://github.com/sparkfun/Line_Follower_Array).
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FrenchFriesForBallerina/bit-calculator.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the project (by default, runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))
   ```sh
   npm run
   ```
